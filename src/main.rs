// * a crate is a single compilation unit in Rust
// * a crate can be compiled into a library or a binary
// * The presence of the ! indicates that you are calling a macro

// * Most lines of Rust end in a semicolon
// * cargo check, cargo run and cargo build

// If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude,
// you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a use statement.

    // * by default values in Rust are immutable but
    // * we can use the mut keyword to override this behaviour
    // * As you can see Rust is statically and Strongly typed

    let mut guess = String::new();

    // the Rust analyzer adds the type declaration on the left side

    // it seems that instead of using the dot syntax to call functions rust relies on the :: syntax
